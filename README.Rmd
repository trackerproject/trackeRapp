# trackeRapp <img src="README_files/hex_trackeRapp.svg" width="320" align="right">

[**trackeRapp**](https://trackerapp.com) is a
[**shiny**](http://shiny.rstudio.com) interface for the analysis and
tracking of athletic activity data in R.

**trackeRapp** builds on the extensive infrastructure provided by the
[**trackeR**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=trackeR) R package to
provide a user-friendly web-interface of an integrated workflow for
the analysis of running, cycling and swimming data from GPS-enabled
tracking devices. The interface offers a range of flexible interactive
visualisations and data-analytic tools.

**trackeRapp** offers functionality to import, clean and organise data
from raw activity files of popular formats (tcx, gpx, json and db3) in
a structured R object, and finally to export that object so that it
can be used for future analyses not only within **trackeRapp** but
also for more advanced modelling in R.

## Installation

**trackeRapp** can be installed by typing

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("trackeRapp")
```

The development version of **trackeRapp** can also be installed directly from github by doing

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("trackerproject/trackeRapp")
```

## Getting started

See the [**tour de trackeRapp**](https://trackerproject.github.io/trackeRapp/) pages for tutorial videos, explanation of the workflow and visualizations that **trackeRapp** offers, and to, generally, learn more about **trackeRapp** and all of its capabilities.


Below are just a few screenshots from the **trackeRapp** web interface

## Video channel
**trackeRapp** has a dedicated [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY6y-pw8d1kek1WAIWiVhhw). The
channel features video tutorials about **trackeRapp** and the
workflow it provides.

## Launching the user-interface

The web-interface can be accessed remotely at <https://www.trackerapp.com> or on a local machine by doing:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# Load the package
library("trackeRapp")
# Open the interface in the browser
trackeR_app()
```
